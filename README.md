Hi, I'm **Oliver**. ðŸ‘‹ I am a developer, husband and cat daddy.

By day, I work as the CTO of [alfa Media Partner GmbH](https://alfamedia.com). We built web and cloud-based solutions for the media industry. In my spare time, I am an Elixir enthusiast and Python lover. Functional programming has always inspired me. Python was the first language in my career that I felt really productive in. Java and JavaScript is where I earn my money.
