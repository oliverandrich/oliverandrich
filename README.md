Hi, I'm **Oliver**. ðŸ‘‹ I am a developer, husband and cat daddy.

By day, I work as the CTO of [alfa Media Partner GmbH](https://alfamedia.com). We built web and cloud-based solutions for the media industry. In my spare time, I am an Elixir enthusiast and Python lover. Functional programming has always inspired me. Python was the first language in my career that I felt really productive in. Python, Java and JavaScript is where I earn my money.

I am part of the [django-commons](https://github.com/django-commons$0) team and maintain [django-tailwind-cli](https://github.com/django-commons/django-tailwind-cli), which I started a few years ago. My other open source projects can be found on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/oliverandrich).
